While I don't have access to specific internal documents or the most current policies, I can provide you with a general overview of leave policies that many companies, including likely similar aspects at Nestlé, may have. However, for detailed and up-to-date Nestlé-specific policies, please refer to your employee handbook or contact your HR department.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Annual Leave/Vacation Days**: Employees are typically entitled to a set number of paid vacation days per year. The number of days may vary based on factors like length of service, job level, and country-specific labor laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sick Leave**: Companies usually offer a certain number of days off for illness. This can vary greatly depending on the country and local laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Parental Leave**: This includes maternity, paternity, and adoption leave. Policies will vary depending on local laws and may include paid and unpaid leave options.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Public Holidays**: Employees are usually given time off for national or public holidays. The specific days off will depend on the country or region.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bereavement Leave**: Employees may be entitled to leave for the death of a close family member. The length of this leave can vary by company.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Unpaid Leave**: Employees can sometimes request unpaid leave for various personal reasons, subject to managerial approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Compassionate Leave**: Some companies offer paid or unpaid leave for personal emergencies or family issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Jury Duty/Witness Leave**: Many companies offer paid leave if an employee is called to serve on a jury or as a witness in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Study or Sabbatical Leave**: Some companies offer extended leave for educational purposes or a sabbatical for long-term employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, for detailed information, please contact the Nestlé HR department or consult the specific Nestlé employee handbook available to you, as these will provide the most accurate and localized information.\n"
